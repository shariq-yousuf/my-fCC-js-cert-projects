# JS Algorithms & Data Structures Work (freeCodeCamp)

[See All Projects live](https://shariq-yousuf.github.io/my-fCC-js-cert-projects/)<hr>

This repository showcases my work from the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification. Explore my solutions to challenges and exercises, covering essential topics like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, DOM manipulation, and more. I've explored algorithms and data structures, implementing solutions for sorting, searching and other key concepts. Additionally, you'll find code demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, working with local storage, and fetching data using APIs. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
